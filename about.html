			<h1>About Us</h1>
			Presidential Candidate: Alison J. Wall
			Vice Presidential Candidate: Reiley N. Lorentz
			Campaign Manager: Nicholas S. Demkowicz
			Party Secretary: Nicholas T. Eiffert
			“Vote for Wall and have it all”
			We believe that students should choose their own path in life and everyone should have equal opportunity. School is a time to learn and grow academically and socially, and everyone should be able to experience this in a safe and friendly environment.
